Now we will define our 2 "hidden layers". It's called "hidden" because it sits between the input and output, and we don't directly interact with it—only the neural network does during training.

We call it "hidden" because:
- We can see the INPUT layer (we provide the data)
- We can see the OUTPUT layer (we see the predictions)
- But the hidden layers are in the MIDDLE - we can't directly see or control what happens there.
- The neural network learns and adjusts the hidden layer weights automatically during training
